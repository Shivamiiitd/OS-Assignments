There is not any deadlock in this part. It is because since now every philosopher needs only 1 fork to eat. 
So let us say all have picked up their left fork. Now for eating they all need a bowl. There are total 4 bowls 
on the table. So among those 5 philosophers 4 philosophers can take those bowls and can start eating. Now 
whenever any philosopher finish his eating, now the 5th philosopher can take that bowl and now he can eat too. 
Deadlock is the condition where no philosopher is able to eat. But here we saw, every philosopher get a chance to 
eat. So there is not any deadlock. Since there is not any deadlock, I am not submitting any code for it.
